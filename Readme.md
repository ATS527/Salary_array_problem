(Salesperson Salary Ranges) Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem. 
A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople each receive ₨. 500 per week
plus 9 percent of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who grosses ₨. 5000 in sales in a week receives Rs. 500 plus 9 percent of Rs. 5000, or a total of Rs. 950. Sales Amount and Commission should be stored. Write a program that determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges (assume that each salesperson’s salary is truncated to an integer amount):

₨.500–599
₨.600–699
₨.700–799
₨.800–899
₨.900–999
₨.1000  and over
